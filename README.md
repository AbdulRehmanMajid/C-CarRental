The Car Rental System is a console-based C++ application designed to manage car rentals in an efficient and user-friendly way. The system reads car information stored in text files, prompts users to enter the number of days they wish to rent a vehicle, and calculates the rental cost accordingly. Once the user inputs the desired rental period, the system generates a receipt detailing the cost of the rental based on the selected car and the rental duration. This program serves as a foundational model for building more advanced car rental management systems.

## Features
- #### Data Loading: The system loads car details, including car type, model, and price per day, from external text files.
- #### Rental Duration Input: The user is prompted to input the number of days they want to rent the selected car.
- #### Dynamic Pricing: The system calculates rental costs dynamically based on the chosen car and rental duration.
- #### Receipt Generation: After the rental information is processed, the system generates a detailed receipt that includes the car's information, rental duration, and total cost.
- #### Error Handling: The program includes basic error handling to ensure the user provides valid inputs for both the car selection and rental duration.
